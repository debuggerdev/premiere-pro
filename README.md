File - New - Project - Name - Ok

File - Import - Choose file then imported files will be bottom left corner "Project Panel" (Sort and display by however you want there)
Quick tip - Double click anywhere on 'Project panel' to import files quickly
Then drag the imported file (mp4 or img) to the bottom right corner "Timeline" to create a sequence (can do with multiple files) - V is for videos, A is for audios
Make sure to only move V(video) NOT A(audio) across to edit
Use the 'razor' icon from the tool bar (left side of the timeline panel) to cut off the unwanted scenes
Then click the empty gap then click 'delet' to stitch two scenes next to each other (or drag right or left works the same)
If you want to zoom in click '+' on your keyboard, if you want to zoom out then click '-' on your keyboard
Top right corner - 'Program panel' change from full(resolution) to 1/2 or 1/4 if your laptop struggle to play back
Color correcting/grading - Window - Lumitri Color (Not needed at this moment so I skip for now)
You can copy past any sequences (control c & v)

Click 'Effects' - 'Video Transitions' - 'Dissolve'(one of the most commonly used one) - 'Cross dissolve' (dip to black and white are popular too)
Then drag it to the in between of the 2 scences you want to have effect with
Levelling Audio - I don't need it now so I skip. (1:04:57 - 1:12:00 -> if you need to know)
Text & lower thirds(meaning it's lower than the third part of the screen)
Go to 'T' from the tool bar - Click anywhere you want in the clip(From program panel) - Window - Essenstial Graphics - Opens up the panel on the far right - Click 'Edit'
If you want some effects for the text, go to 'Appearance' and play around
When you inert text it creates its own layer and you can add transition effects at the beginning and end

Select H.264 then click Export (for MP4) - Output name to change file name and pick location
Rest of the video will explain how to upload on Youtube
Tutorial 1. (For complete beginners) - This one is short and sweet. Only covers the very basics.

How to use fonts in Adobe softwares
Go to https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts and activate fonts you want to use
Tutorial 2. (Premiere Pro Essentials Tutorial Course) - Useful but goes on for almost 2 hours. If you don't have 2 hrs, refer to the note I made above.

Tutorial 3. (How to mask) - TikTok app store ad reference
https://youtu.be/Bi8Rc4hPl0A
Import 2 files you want to work with and make sequences of those in the timeline
Raise up the clip you want to make a mask for(clip no.1)
Move the other clip which is going to be playing within the mask to be inline with the first clip(clip no.2)
Make sure your playback is at the 'beginning' of the video clip(clip no.1)
Also click on & highlight the clip no.1 to make sure the changes you make go to the right clip
Go to top left corner (Effects controls panel) - Opacity - Three shapes from there (ellipse, rectangle & pen) - Choose pen if you need a shape other than ellipse or rectangle)
You will see a few options such as Mask path, Mask feather, Mask opacity, Mask expansion
Select pen - Draw lines you want to use as a mask from 'Program panel' (Top right corner)
Choose inverted (from Effects controls panel)
Now you can see through clip no.2 through the shape you made on clip no 1.
Tutorial 4. (How to zoom in to the masked scene) - TikTok app store ad reference (I'm using this for my task given by the company)
https://youtu.be/Nsa2kMwyyLE (This video explains how to mask, track then zoom in to the masked object - It's really cool and useful however I don't need to track at this point, just refer to mask then zoom in. Make sure to come back and master the tracking feature later.)
Mask the object from clip no.1 by using the pen tool
Use bright/contrast from the same panel (Effects controls panel) after clicking 'invert' to highlight the object.
Then move the playhead line to the point where you want to object to be zoomed in all the way
Go to Position and Scale from Motion (in Effects controls panel) and change the numbers as you wish
If you want to make the zooming faster, make the keyframes closer to each other (https://youtu.be/YvWVHUXRwpE)
Boom! there you have it. :)
Tutorial 5. (How to create text animation) - Come back and learn this later. --> This one is useful. Use it for the current project.

How to use png or vector files in Premiere Pro
Go to Illustrator -> File -> Export -> Export for Screens -> Change Scale to 5000px -> Export artboard -> From Premeier Pro, select file from folder named '5000'
Problem/Solution
When Dissove effect is not placed between the two sequences (but on only 1 sequence), you need to change the duration of the dissolve effect to the longer. This will make it go over both sequences

Copy and paste clips by dragging in the Timeline
Press the Alt (Windows), or Option (Mac OS) key.
Select one or more clips in the sequence, and then drag them to a new location in the Timeline. You can drag them horizontally or vertically. After dropping the clips in a new location, they are duplicated.
